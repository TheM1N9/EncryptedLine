1. **User Authentication**:
   - Users are required to enter a username to join the chat.
   - Only specific usernames (e.g., 'user1', 'user2', 'user3') are allowed to join, as defined in the server-side code.
   - If the entered username is not in the list of allowed usernames, authentication fails, and an error message is displayed.

2. **Real-time Chat**:
   - Once authenticated, users can send messages in real-time.
   - Messages are broadcasted to all connected clients using Socket.IO.
   - Each message includes the username of the sender and the message content.
   - Messages are displayed in a chat interface with a timestamp.

3. **Active Users List**:
   - The application displays a list of active users in a sidebar.
   - When a user joins or leaves the chat, the active users list is updated accordingly and broadcasted to all clients.

4. **Typing Indicator**:
   - When a user starts typing a message, a typing indicator is displayed to other users.
   - When the user stops typing, the typing indicator disappears.

5. **Styling and Layout**:
   - The application has a responsive layout that adjusts to different screen sizes.
   - Styling is done using CSS to enhance the visual appeal and usability of the application.
   - Different background colors are used for messages from different users to differentiate them visually.

6. **Server-side Processing**:
   - The server-side code is responsible for handling user connections, disconnections, and message broadcasting.
   - It maintains a list of active users and manages user authentication.

Overall, the web application provides a simple yet functional chat experience with basic features such as user authentication, real-time messaging, and active user management.
